**Author:** Bocaletto Luca

**Language:** Python

## Description
"Chorus" is a Python application developed by Luca Bocaletto that allows you to create the audio effect known as Chorus. This application provides users with the ability to adjust various parameters of the Chorus effect to creatively modify audio. The Chorus effect is widely used in audio production to add depth and spatiality to sound, creating the impression of multiple musicians or singers performing simultaneously.

## Key Features

- **Parameter Adjustment:** Users can adjust the following parameters of the Chorus effect:
  - Chorus Delay: The delay between audio repeats, measured in milliseconds.
  - Intensity: The intensity of the Chorus effect, controlling how pronounced the effect is.
  - LFO Rate (Low-Frequency Oscillator): The modulation rate of the Chorus effect, influencing the speed at which the sound oscillates.
  - Feedback: Feedback determines how much of the processed audio is fed back into the Chorus process, affecting the persistence of sound repeats.
  - Mix: The balance between the original audio and the processed Chorus audio.
- **Activation/Deactivation:** The application allows users to toggle the Chorus effect on or off with a simple button.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** The user interface is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, featuring sliders for each parameter and a clear display of current values.
- **Real-Time Audio Processing:** The application processes audio in real-time, enabling users to immediately listen to the Chorus effect.

## Usage
1. Adjust the Chorus effect parameters using the corresponding sliders to achieve the desired sound.
2. Press the "Activate/Deactivate Chorus" button to enable or disable the Chorus effect.
3. Listen to the audio with the Chorus effect applied in real-time.

"Chorus" is a valuable tool for musicians, music producers, and audio enthusiasts looking to experiment with the Chorus effect and add depth and resonance to their audio recordings.

**Note:** Make sure you have installed the necessary libraries listed in the code to run the application properly.
